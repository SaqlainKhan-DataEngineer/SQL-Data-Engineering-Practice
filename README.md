# SQL Data Engineering Practice

## Project: E-commerce Revenue Analysis
In this project, I solved a business problem to track high-revenue categories.

### Key Concepts Used:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** For temporary calculations.
- **Views:** Created permanent reporting structures.
- **Window Functions vs Group By:** Optimized aggregation logic.
- **Data Filtering:** Used `HAVING` clause for aggregate filtering.

### Tools:
- MySQL
